# Buggy Contract

This Solidity contract contains functions designed to demonstrate different ways of handling errors in smart contracts. The contract is intended for educational and demonstration purposes.

## Functions

### `willAssert()`

This function uses the `assert` statement to demonstrate a case where the assertion will always fail. The assertion `assert(false == true)` will always fail as it's attempting to assert a false proposition. This function is used to illustrate the behavior of `assert`.

### `willRequire()`

The `willRequire()` function uses the `require` statement to verify a condition and revert the transaction if that condition is not met. In this case, the condition `false == true` will always be false, resulting in the transaction being reverted. This function is used to demonstrate the usage of `require`.

### `willRevert()`

This function uses the `revert` statement to revert the transaction with a custom error message. In this case, it simply calls `revert('')` without a specific message, resulting in a revert with an empty message. This function is used to demonstrate how to use `revert` to revert transactions with custom messages.

## Usage

The contract provides these functions as examples of how to handle errors in Solidity. You can deploy the contract on an Ethereum-compatible network and call any of the public functions to see their behavior.

**Note:** Please note that this contract is designed to demonstrate errors and should not be used in a production environment.
